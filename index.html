     <h3><u>Bio</u></h3>
         <p>A Perfect Circle is an American rock supergroup formed in 1999 by guitarist Billy Howerdel and Tool vocalist Maynard James Keenan.
         A Perfect Circle has released four studio albums, the first three releasing in the early 2000s: Mer de Noms, their debut album in 2000, 
         and followed up by Thirteenth Step in 2003; then in 2004, Emotiveâ€”an album of radically re-worked cover songs titles.</p>
        <p>Prone to downtime due to Keenan's other musical commitments, the band has featured a variety of musicians in the other roles throughout
        ts alternating periods of activity and inactivity. The original incarnation of the band included Paz Lenchantin on bass, Troy Van Leeuwen on guitar,
        and Josh Freese on drums. Primus drummer Tim Alexander had briefly stood in as a drummer prior to Freese in the band's initial live shows, 
         however this was prior to releasing any material. Band collaborator and producer Danny Lohner and Marilyn Manson bassist Jeordie White
         were also members for a short period in the early 2000s. The band's current lineup features Smashing Pumpkins guitarist James Iha, 
         bassist Matt McJunkins, and drummer Jeff Friedl, the latter two also being contributors to the related Puscifer and Ashes Divide projects.
         Despite the varied cast and numerous lineup changes, the stylistic content of A Perfect Circle's songs has remained consistent with Howerdel
        as music composer, and Keenan writing lyrics and vocal melodies. The band's studio albums have been generally well received critically and 
         commercially, with their three studio albums selling 4 million copies collectively as of 2005. </p>
